Tweerex
============

v0.2
Massive code cleanup. Code is finaly readable
Code is not outputting useless chars into your console anymore.
XML structure has been removed from the regexes file, making it easier to add and remove regexes.
Creditcard regexes have been removed, caused too many false-positives

v0.1
Very messy piece of code allowing you to regex tweets.
Not a lot to it. Hopefully this tool will grow in the future to something decent.
