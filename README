Tweerex
============

Tweerex is a tool you can run to fetch the public twitterfeed and match incomming tweets agains a local regex db.
Just have a browse trough the code. Fairly easy to use I think.
Added a few simple regex examples:
1. Search for CVV codes in tweets
2. Look for the word vulnerability
3. Look for tweets containing the text .nse. This probably contains a link to a nmap script

Please do share interesting regexes ;) - use the git repo or http://www.damnsecure.org
